# Reentry
Re-Entry into the Earth's atmosphere of a space shuttle

MATLAB/GNU Octave

First of all, yes the comments are in french because we had to submit it to a French University for evaluation, I will see if I can translate it soon.

This was a project during my last year of  Bachelor. Time was very restricted and the point of the assessment was to see if we could write a model using MATLAB's built-in differential equation solver. Now that I look at it, 2.5 years later, I want to get back into it and finish it completely, so now this is one of my active projects.

Plan:

(1) Translate to English.

(2) Add missing components.

(3) Polish.

(4) Write loop to find optimum parameters. (If it can be done with this model. When we did this model we were told not to write the loops about finding optimum parameters, just to do the basic model and try to do the bonus questions if we had the time to.)


p.s. The uploaded files are not the final versions submitted, it is the one that tried to start to materialise the answers to extra bonus questions.
